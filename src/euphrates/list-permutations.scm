;; This implements an algorithm known as "Ord-Smith".  (It is described in a
;; paper called "Permutation Generation Methods" by Robert Sedgewlck, listed as
;; Algorithm 8.)  It has a number of good properties: it is very fast, returns
;; a list of results that has a maximum number of shared list tails, and it
;; returns a list of reverses of permutations in lexical order of the input,
;; except that the list itself is reversed so the first permutation is equal to
;; the input and the last is its reverse.  In other words, (map reverse
;; (permutations (reverse l))) is a list of lexicographically-ordered
;; permutations (but of course has no shared tails at all -- I couldn't find
;; anything that returns sorted results with shared tails efficiently).  I'm
;; not listing these features in the documentation, since I'm not sure that
;; there is a need to expose them as guarantees -- but if there is, then just
;; revise the docs.  (Note that they are tested.)
;;
;; In addition to all of this, it has just one loop, so it is easy to turn it
;; into a "streaming" version that spits out the permutations one-by-one, which
;; could be used with a "callback" argument as in the paper, or can implement
;; an efficient `in-permutations'.  It uses a vector to hold state -- it's easy
;; to avoid this and use a list instead (in the loop, the part of the c vector
;; that is before i is all zeros, so just use a list of the c values from i and
;; on) -- but that makes it slower (by about 70% in my timings).
