;; This procedure computes the GOTO function for LR(1) items.
;; Given a state (set of LR(1) items) and a grammar symbol (terminal or non-terminal),
;; it computes the new set of LR(1) items (the GOTO state) that results from reading
;; that symbol from the given state.
;;
;; The GOTO function transitions the parser from one state to another by shifting the dot (â€¢)
;; over a grammar symbol. Formally, if I is a set of items and X is a grammar symbol,
;; GOTO(I, X) is the closure of the set of items obtained by shifting the dot
;; in each item of I over X.
