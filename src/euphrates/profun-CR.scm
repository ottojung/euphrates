;; Profun's Custom Results

;; Returned by an agent that wants to overwrite the resulting query.
;; Every other results except this abort's `what' must be ignored.
;; Results are not in the form `(((X . 1) (Y . 2) ...) ...)' but in the form of a query to evaluate that will return that type of the result.
